# Â¡Spotify App!
(WIP)
## Description
This will be a server+frontend app similar to Spotify, where you can listen to music, create playlist, comment on songs and playlists.
Inspired by my previous project, [EarthSound](https://github.com/Varo95/EarthSound)
I now will remade it from the ground to work with SpringBoot and PrimeFaces, AllInOne App, portable and easy to use.
## Requirements
- Java 21
